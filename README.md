## Ivy

**Ivy** (Intelligent Voice for You) is a lightweight, privacy-focused voice assistant designed to provide a natural interaction experience without relying on complex cloud-based AI systems. It combines speech recognition, hotword detection, and intelligent command processing to create a responsive digital companion that runs primarily on your local machine.

It is more than a virtual assistant itâ€™s a concept of a personal digital companion that blends usability with human-like interaction. It incorporates lightweight NLP (Natural Language Processing) features and intelligent command interpretation for a smoother experience

Unlike traditional voice assistants, Ivy focuses on offline lightweight intelligence prioritizing usability, speed, and human-computer interaction rather than complex AI systems.

I.V.Y. is the system that powers everything and Ivy is the voice of that system the one you hear and talk to.

## Installation

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated

```bash
python -m venv venvivy
```

Then, if you have installed to activate:

```bash
# On windows:
venvivy\Scripts\activate
# On MacOS/Linux:
source venvivy/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you are on VSCode you must select the python interpreter that you locally created e.g. "venivy"
