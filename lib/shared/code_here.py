"""_INSTRUCTIONS_

Instructions!!!

How to contribute code to this project:

1.) Duplicate this file and rename it according to the feature you are adding.
    - Use **snake_case** for filenames: e.g., `file_name.py`
    - Avoid `FileName.py` or `fileName.py`.

2.) Implement your feature in the new file.
    - Keep functions modular and reusable.
    - Add docstrings or comments explaining what each function does.

3.) Test your code locally before committing.
    - Ensure it runs without errors.
    - Verify it doesnâ€™t break existing functionality.

4.) Stage and commit your changes using Git.
    - Use a clear commit message describing your feature:
      Example: `git commit -m "Add feature_x for speech recognition"`

5.) Push your branch to the shared repository.
    - Preferably create a separate branch for your feature:
      `git checkout -b feature/feature_name`

6.) Open a Pull Request (PR) for review.
    - Assign reviewers if necessary.
    - Include a short description of the changes and usage instructions.

7.) Merge only after the code is approved and passes testing.
    - Keep the main branch stable and functional at all times.

Optional:
- Update documentation or instructions if your feature adds new behavior.
- Follow the existing code style and formatting conventions.
